This project utilizes [Truffle Suite](https://www.trufflesuite.com/) to automate testing.

You will need to install [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/truffle):

```
npm install truffle -g
```

and [Ganache CLI](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache-cli):

```
npm install -g ganache-cli
```

Once installed, run Ganache CLI in a terminal:

```
My-Comp:~ johndoe$ ganache-cli
```

Then, from the root of this project, run the tests:

truffle test
```
